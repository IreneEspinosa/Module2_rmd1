# This is a level 1 header

## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

when we comoile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here are some example R commads:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice

Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice

Here is an example of blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.

Here is an example of nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested

Here is an example of blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```


## Insert Tables

### with **kable ()** function

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption ="Top 6 Rows of Cars Dataset")
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), digits =2, align = c(rep("l", 4), rep("c", 4), rep("r", 4)))
```

### with pandoc formats

--------------------------------------------------------
Centered  Default     Right  Left
 Header   Aligned   Aligned  Aligned
--------- -------- --------  -----------------------
First     row      12.0      Example of a row that spans multiple lines.

Second    row      5.0       Here's another one. Note the blank line between rows.
---------------------------------------------------------

+---------+---------+---------+-------------+
|Centered | Default |   Right | Left        |

|First    | row     | 12.0    | Example of a row that spans multiple lines.|
+---------+---------+---------+-------------+
|Second   | row     |  5.0    | Here's another one. Note the blank line between rows.|
+---------+---------+---------+-------------+

### With `stargazer()` for summarizing regresion models and others (see `stargazer_models`, help page)

```{r star, results = 'asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(stargazer, quietly = TRUE)

fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, mtcars)
fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + disp, mtcars)

stargazer(fit1, fit2, fit3, type = 'html', 
          column.labels = c("model 1","model 2","model 3"),
          column.separate = c(1,1,1))
```

#### correlation matrix with `stargazer()` function

```{r star1, results = 'asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(stargazer, quietly = TRUE)
#change type according output : latex, html
correlation.matrix <- cor(attitude[,c("rating","complaints","privileges")])
stargazer(correlation.matrix, title="Correlation Matrix", type = 'html')
```

## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$

## Insert images

Here is an image inserted

![](Logo enero2017.jpg)

this only works in html formats
![r logo](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)


## Insert an Animated GIF and video (only works in html formats)

```{r}
#![sunstar](sunstar/sunstar.gif)
```

## Insert text with some footnotes

Here is footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inline notes are easier to write, since you donÂ´t have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

[^1]: Here is a footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
